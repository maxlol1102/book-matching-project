# Book Matching Project

## Overview
The **Book Matching Project** is designed to extract and store book data from two sources:
1. **BooksToScrape**: A website that provides a large collection of book data.
2. **Open Library**: An open-source library of books with extensive metadata.

The project collects data from both sources, stores it in relational tables, and provides an interface to download and analyze the data.
